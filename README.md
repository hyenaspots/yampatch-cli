#Yampatch v0.0.0

##Syntax

`yampatch <target> [ops-file ...]`

This will write the target file, as modified by applying the go-patch-compliant ops-files, to stdout.

##Release notes

The MIT License warns that this software is provided without any warranty express or implied. That's, like, a super-good warning for this release.

Also, future versions are likely to use a flag syntax instead of positional arguments.
